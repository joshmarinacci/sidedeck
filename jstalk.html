                    something that powers the web. Javascript.
                </li>
                <li>            * I've been using JS since 95/96, so over 20 years. man, that makes me feel
                    old. I realize now that some of you in the audience may not be as old
                    as Javascript itself.

        <h1>What is ES6?</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>EcmaScript 6</li>
            <li>EcmaScript 2015</li>
            <li>ES 2015</li>
            <li>The new stuff</li>
        </ul>

        <aside>
            <ul>
                <li>

            * JavaScript has had many versions over the years, but overall
            the evolution was slow until recently. More changes have happened in the past
            three years than in the previous decades. and that's why I created this talk.
                </li>
<li>
            * ES 6 stands for EcmaScript 6. It's also called EcmaScript 2015,
            or ES 2015.  These are all different names for the 'new Javascript'.
</li>

                <li>
            * I'm not entirely sure *why* JS has changed so much recently, but I
            I suspect it's because of competiton from other web targeted
            languages like Typescript and Coffeescript.
                </li>

                <li>
            *  Also, the advent of transpilers have made it possible to use new
            language features *before* they are built into the browsers.
            I'll talk a bit more about transpilers in a moment.

        <h1>Why ES6 matters</h1>
        <aside>
            <p>
            JS matters because it's the fabric of the web, and increasingly used
            for server side apps with Node, and mobile and desktop apps with Cordova,
            React Native, and Electron.

                <p>
            Thanks to new JS implementations like V8 JS is fast, really fast, and
            has access to new powerful web apis like WebGL that are also fun.

            <p>
            In short: JS is everywhere. So it matters that we push it forward.
            Languages which don't evolve start to die. The other reason to make
            JS better is simply that it's awesome if JS gets better. Our code
            can improve. our apps can have fewer bugs. And some of these
            features enable the runtimes to actually run code faster.
        </aside>

    <section>
        <h1>Too much new</h1>
        <h3>Let's be useful instead</h3>
        <aside>
            <p>So hopefully I've convinced you that JS is awesome and so new JS features is
                a good thing. But That's the problem. Waaay
            too many cool new things. Some are more valuable than others. Some are
            more ready than others. it’s confusing, too many things in different
            states of readiness.</p>

            <p>So that's why I created this class. To show you the four features of
                ES6 that are both useful and ready to use now.
                Some of the others will be ready at some point, and we'll touch on them a little bit,
                but you can ignore them for now. We are just going to talk about what you can use right now, right here, today.

    <section>
        <h1>The Problems with Variables</h1>
        <aside>
            <p>let's start with variables</p>
            <p>normally when you want to create a variable you use the 'var' keyword.
                'var' is great, but it has a couple of problems.</p>
        </aside>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Variables always vary</h2>
        <pre class='javascript code'>
var VARS = {
    foo
        set = function() { }
        get = function() { return 42 }
}
VARS.foo = 42; // now I have a constant
        </pre>
        <aside>
            first, var is always <b>variable</b>. there is no way to make a constant. if
            you really want a constant you have to create a property of an
            object and override the setter so that it can't be set.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Function Scoping</h2>
        <pre>
function badCode() {
    if(foo) {
        var x = 5;
    }
    if(bar) {
        console.log(x);
    }
}
        </pre>
        <aside>
        <p>* another problem is that vars are global to the function they are
        defined in, not the block. you'd think that the log
        statement wouldn't work because
        <b>bar</b> is defined in a different block.
            <p>
        and in a language like java or C# you'd be right, but in
        js var is global to a function, not a block.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Hoisting</h2>
        <pre>
function badCode() {
    console.log("foo is",foo);
    var foo = 'bar';
}
        </pre>
        <aside>
            <p>another problem is that variables are <b>hoisted</b>.

            <p>
            look at this code.  i'm using foo before i've even defined it.
            what does this code even mean?  under the hood the javascript
            engine will hoist the variable declaration to the top of the
            function.  i can sort of see why you might want to hoist
            functions, but variable hoisting makes it very easy to introduce subtle bugs.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Hoisting</h2>
        <pre>
for(var i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
console.log(i);
        </pre>
        <aside>
            look at this code with a <b>for</b> loop.
        the variable is only used inside the loop, but i can still
        reference it outside. that's crazy. this is just bugs waiting to happen.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>A better way</h2>
        <h1><code>const</code> and <code>let</code></h1>
        <aside>
            the good news is we don't have to use var anymore. instead we can use const and let.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1><code>const</code></h1>
        <pre class='javascript'>function test() {
    const foo = 'bar';
    foo = 'baz'; //error
}</pre>
        <aside>
            <b>const</b> does exactly what the name suggests. It makes a real
            constant. If you try to set the constant you'll get an error.
            even better, code linting systems can detect this kind of bug at
            compile time now, so you can find bugs earlier at development
            time rather than in production.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1><code>let</code></h1>
        <pre>function goodCode() {
    if(foo) {
        let x = 5;
    }
    if(bar) {
        console.log(x); //error
    }
}        </pre>
        <aside>
            <b>let</b> is just like <b>var</b>, it's a way to create variables, but it's
            scoped by block instead of function. now it does what we expect. you can't use
            x outside of it's block, so now we will get a proper error.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1><code>let</code></h1>
        <pre>function goodCode() {
    for(let i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log(i); //error
}</pre>
        <aside>
            Look at this <b>for</b> loop, now the <b>i</b> variable is restricted to the
            <b>for</b> loop. there is no way it can be used outside accidentally.
            Also, <b>let</b> isn't hoisted, so all of those magic moving variables
            go away.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Template Literals: Super Strings</h1>
        <pre>var q  = 'foo';
var qq = "foo";

var bq = `foo`;

var qq = "Sally sells \"sea shells\"";
var bq = `Sally sells "sea shells"`;</pre>
        <aside>
            <p>ES6 introduces a new type of string called Template Literals. I
                prefer to call them super strings. You use it just
            like a regular string, but instead of using single or double quotes,
            you use the back quote.</p>
            <p>So far so good, but nothing is very different.
            It does have an advantage of when you need to use double or
            single quotes inside of a string you don't need to escape them anymore.
            but this new string does some other stuff too.</p>
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Multi-line Strings</h1>
        <pre>var qq = "this is a very long"
    + " piece of text that goes over several lines"
    + " and would require silly hacks";

var bq = `this is a very long
    piece of text that goes over several lines
    and would require silly hacks`;</pre>
        <aside>We finally have multi-line strings.
            Need to quote several lines of something? You don't have to
            escape newlines or do join tricks anymore. Just put in the newlines
            directly and it works.</aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Template Strings</h1>
        <pre>var name = "Alice";
var greeting = `Good morning ${name}`;
var amount = 5;
var price = 3;
var sales = `That costs ${amount*price} dollars`;</pre>
        <aside>
            Multiline support is <b>great</b> for doing templates.
            Which is where another new feature comes in, <b>expression escaping</b>.
            Within a super string you can put <b>${}</b> and anything inside the brackets
            can be any Javascript expression. This is much cleaner than
            double escaping your quotes, and it makes templates easier to
            build.
        </aside>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>HTML Templates</h1>
        <pre>var template = `
  &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Good morning ${name}&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          That item will cost you
          &lt;b&gt;${amount*price}&lt;/b&gt;
          dollars.
      &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
`</pre>
        <aside>
            Here's a more complex example. You'll notice that my syntax highlighting library recognizes
            the expressions inside of the strings and colors them properly. it really makes it easier
            to when you are writing html or other languages mixed inside your javascript.
        </aside>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h1>Arrow Functions</h1>
        <aside>
            So that was templates. Let's jump to something new , <b>Arrow functions.</b>
            Arrow functions are a different syntax for regular
            functions. they let you write the same code in a more
            compact way, along with one very important difference.
            the 'this' variable means something different. lets' look at some code.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Good</h2>
        <pre>var output = [];
for(var i=0; i&lt;input.length; i++) {
    output[i] = input[i] * 2;
}</pre>
        <aside>
            suppose you want to loop over an array to double the values within it,
            producing a new array. you could do it this way with a for loop,
            but that creates extra variables and it can be easy to accidentially
            break early or get the index wrong. plus it's a lot of extra typing.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Better</h2>
        <pre>var output = input.map(function(x) {
    return x * 2;
});</pre>
        <aside>
            Javascript arrays have a function called <b>map</b> which calls a
            function on every element to generate a new element,
            which are then placed into a new array.
            still, it would be nice to make it smaller.
            the x*2 part is the only thing which actually does any work.
            the rest is syntactic overhead.
            instead we can do it with an arrow function like this
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Best</h2>
        <pre>var output = input.map((x)=>x*2);</pre>
        <aside>
            Now that is beautiful and compact and clear. let me explain what's happening.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Arrow Functions</h1>
        <pre>function (x) {
    return x * 2;
}</pre>
        <pre>(x) => {
    return x * 2;
}</pre>
        <aside>
            <p>arrow functions let us write the same thing smaller. Get rid of the word <b>function</b>
                and add the equals greater than which together we call the <b>arrow</b> symbol
            </p>
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Arrow Functions</h1>
        <pre>(x) => { return x * 2; }</pre>
        <aside>
            but we can make it even shorter. let's remove the whitespace. that's better [code].
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Arrow Functions</h1>
        <pre>(x) => x * 2</pre>
        <pre>var output = input.map((x)=>x*2);</pre>
        <aside>
            But we can make it even shorter still! if your arrow function is just <b>one line</b> that <b>returns it's value</b>
            then can remove the return and the
            braces and semicolon and we get just this tiny thing. it's so much cleaner.
            We can read this as <b>x goes to x * 2</b>. Beautiful.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>The curse of <code>this</code></h1>
        <pre>function App() {
    this.clicked = false;

    var button = document.getElementById('button');
    button.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
        this.clicked = true; //won't do what you think
    });
}</pre>
        <aside>
            <p>Now let's talk about <b>this</b>.
            In Javascript the magic variable 'this' always refers to the object
            that the function is called on. so code like what you see here doesn't do what you
                think it does. </p>
                <p>
            when you are using other objects the context may be
            different. when you pass a function to somewhere else to be called back,
                    it may call the function with a different 'this'.</p>
            <p>when you add event
            handlers to a button the button will be the 'this'.
                    which isn't what we want. we want the app to be the 'this'</p>
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>The <code>self</code> pattern</h1>
        <pre>function App() {
    this.clicked = false;

    var button = document.getElementById('button');

    <b>var self = this;</b>
    button.addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
        self.clicked = true;
    });
}</pre>
        <aside>
            this created something known as the 'self' pattern where you save
            the correct `this` using a temp variable called `self`;
            It works but it's kinda yucky. It's a hack. Here's another way to solve it.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Function binding</h1>
        <pre>function App() {
    this.clicked = false;

    var button = document.getElementById('button');

    var callback = (function(evt) {
        this.clicked = true
    })<b>.bind(this);</b>

    button.addEventListener('click',callback);
}</pre>
        <aside>
            <p>another way to solve it is to bind the function.
                'bind' forces the 'this' to be a specific object.</p>
            <p>we create a function then bind it to the this that we want, which is the app,, which produces a new function that we save
                a reference to as 'callback', then we add it to the button.</p>
            <p>Again, it works, but it's a lot of extra typing
                and looks yucky. It obscures what we are actually trying to do.</p>
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <pre>function App() {
    this.clicked = false;

    var button = document.getElementById('button');
    button.addEventListener('click',()=>{
        this.clicked = true;
    });
}</pre>
        <aside>
            <p>Arrow functions give us a better way to do it.
            They automatically capture the `this` variable from the surrounding
                context of where the function <b>is defined</b>, not where it's <b>used</b>.</p>

            <p>This means we can pass the function to some other place and know the
                right version of <b>this</b> will be used.  Here's the same code with an arrow
                function, and now it does what you think it should do.</p>

        <h1>Arrow Functions are Awesome</h1>
        <aside>
            So. Arrow functions are really awesome. I try to use them
            everywhere I can. They make 'this' sensible again. They make your
            code cleaner and clearer. And you can use them in every browser today.

        <h1>Promises for Long Running Work</h1>
        <aside>
            <p>Another great feature of arrow functions is that they work well
            with promises. A <b>promise</b> is a new kind of object in Javascript
                designed to help with things that take a long time.</p>

            <p>You see, javascript doesn't have threads. if you want to do something that
                might take a long time then you have to use callbacks.</p>
            <p>Which results in this...</p>
        </aside>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>Pyramid of Doom</h1>
        <pre>fs.readFile("file.txt", function(err, file) {
    db.fetchNames(function(err, names) {
        processFile(file, names, function(err, outfile) {
            fs.writeFile('file.txt',outfile, function(err, status) {
                console.log("we are done writing the file");
            })
        });
    })
});</pre>
        <aside>
            <p>This is the <b>Pyramid of Doom</b></p>

            <p>Suppose in Node you might want to load a file, parse it,
                make a database request, and then write to a new file.</p>
            <p>these must all be
            done in order, but they are all asynchronous so you have to start
            nesting your callbacks. this produces what js hackers like to
                call the pyramid of doom. massively nested code.</p>

            <p>This code is really ugly, really hard to reason about, and has lots of nasty corners
                for bugs to hide.  promises help us fight this the Pyramid of Doom.</p>

        <h1>What is a promise</h1>
        <pre>var prom = makeSomePromise();
//value isn't ready yet
prom.then((value)=>{
    //do something with the value
})</pre>
        <aside>
            This is a Promise. A <i>Promise</i> is an object that represents a
            value which may not be available yet. It's an object which <b>'promises'</b>
            to have the value in the future.
            You can add a callback to be invoked when the final value is ready.
            like this.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <pre>fs.readFile("file.txt")
    .then((file) => {
        return db.fetchNames().then((names)=>{
            return processFile(file,names)
        })
    })
    .then((outfile)=>{
        return fs.writeFile('file.txt',outfile);
    })
    .then(()=>{
        console.log("we are done writing the file");
    });</pre>

        <aside>
            <p>In this way promises are much like traditional callbacks, but promises add a
            twist.. they can be <b>chained</b>.  </p>

            <p>Let's revisit our code from before.</p>
            <p>Each of these functions must be called in order, and each depends on
            the result of the previous one. Using Promises we can do it like this
                instead.</p>

            <p>Notice how the arrow functions make this nice and clean.
            Each <b>then()</b> callback returns a value.
            This value is passed to the next one so all of our functions can be easily chained.</p>

            <p>Now you'll notice that the <b>processFile</b> command needs the result of the previous
            two values. But a promise only passes one value. Also, we don't care what
                order <b>readFile and fetchNames</b> happens in. We just want to know when both
                are completed. We can do that with <b>Promise.all</b></p>
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <pre>
var proms = filenames.map((name)=> readFile(name));
Promise.all(proms).then((files)=>{
    console.log(`we have ${files.length} files`);
});
        </pre>
        <aside>
            <p>Suppose we have a list of filenames. We want to
                load each file to load each file and be notified when
                all of them have been loaded.
            </p>
            <p>We can do this with <b>Promise.all()</b>. It'sa utility function which
                takes an array of Promises and returns a <b>new promise</b> that
            resolves when all of the sub-promises complete.
            </p>
            <p>In this case it resolves when all of the files have been loaded, and gives us
            an array of the results.</p>
            <p>So let's go rewrite our previous example with promises.</p>
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <pre>
Promise.all([
    fs.readFile("file.txt"),
    db.fetchNames()
])
.then((vals) => processFile(vals[0],vals[1]))
.then((outfile)=> fs.writeFile('file.txt',outfile))
.then(()=> console.log("we are done writing the file"));
        </pre>

        <aside>
            <p>I'm combining the read file and database call into a single promise
                using Promise.all. The resulting value is an array containing
                the results of both, so I can put them into processFile.
                I've also switched to the abbreviated arrow syntax to make
                the code smaller and cleaner. It's so much easier to read now.</p>

            <p>But let's consider what happens if one of these things fails?  if
                the first one fails we could put in a <b>try catch</b> block, but
                the next <b>then</b> will still be called. Really we want everything
                to stop if the first one fails. Promises have another trick up
                their sleeves: the <b>catch</b> callback.</p>
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <pre>
Promise.all([
    fs.readFile("file.txt"),
    db.fetchNames()
])
.then((vals) => processFile(vals[0],vals[1]))
.then((outfile)=> fs.writeFile('file.txt',outfile))
.then(()=> console.log("we are done writing the file"))
<b>.catch((e) => {
    console.log("some error happened");
})
.then(()=> console.log("we are done either way"));</b>
        </pre>
        <aside>
            In this version if anything fails it will immediately jump to the
            <b>catch</b> callback at the end, skipping the rest.  After the <b>catch</b> we
            can still add more <b>then</b> clauses if we want.
        </aside>
    </section>



    <section>
        <pre>
function makePromise(foo,bar) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        try {
            //do long stuff
            resolve(value);
        } catch {
            reject(error);
        }
    });
}
        </pre>
        <aside>
            <p>Of course promises only work if the APIs we call actually use them.
            Fortunately lots of libraries are starting to switch over to
            promises. However, while we wait we can make our own promises too.
                We do it with the <b>Promise</b> object constructor</p>

            <p>It takes two values: <b>resolve</b> and <b>reject</b>. each of these are
                callback functions. Inside you do whatever you need to do that
                takes a long time, even if it involves multiple callbacks.
                When you are completely done invoke <b>resolve()</b> with the final
                value. this will then be sent the the first <b>'then'</b>
                clause of whatever uses your promise.</p>

            <p>If something bad happens and you want to reject the value,
                then instead of throwing an error you can use <b>reject()</b> and you can pass
                whatever alternate value you want.

xml.addEventListener('load', function() {
    var result = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    console.log(result);
});
xml.open("GET",url);
xml.send();
</pre>

        <aside>Here's a real-life example.
            I use AJAX calls all the time but they can be ugly, like this.
            This just does a GET request to a URL which returns some JSON, but there's
            a lot of boilerplate code.  Let's wrap this code up in a promise.
        </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <pre>function doGet(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve,rej)=>{
        var xml = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xml.addEventListener('load', function() {
            var result = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
            resolve(result);
        });
        xml.addEventListener('error',function(error) {
            reject(error);
        });
        xml.open("GET",url);
        xml.send();
    });
}</pre>
<pre>
var url = "http://api.silly.io/api/list/"
    +"e3da7b3b-976d-4de1-a743-e0124ce973b8?format=json";
doGet(url).then((obj)=>{
    console.log(obj);
});
</pre>

    <aside>
        <p>Now it looks like this. I put it inside a promise
            and call resolve or reject when I get a result or an error.</p>
        <p>It's still the same basic code, but i can call it like this instead.</p>
        <p>wow, that's so much cleaner. The only have the two things which matter, the URL
        I'm loading and a JSON result object. The rest of the complexity is hidden inside
        the promise.</p>
    </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <pre>var url = "http://api.silly.io/api/list/"
            +"e3da7b3b-976d-4de1-a743-e0124ce973b8?format=json";
fetch(url).then((obj) => {
    console.log(obj);
});
</pre>
        <aside>
        <p>Now in reality I don't need to wrap up my AJAX calls because there is a new
        web standard called Fetch which already does this for me, but
            I can still make my own if I want to do something custom.</p>

        <h1>Promises are awesome</h1>
        <aside>So promises can be a bit tricky to wrap your head around at
            first because we are dealing with asynchronous control flow.
            But once you start using them I think you'll really like
            them. They make it very easy to pull multiple functions together
            into a single workflow that makes logical sense, and to
            properly catch all errors along the way.</aside>

            However, if we have a little time , I really want to give you some nice bonus features. There's a bunch
            of functions which aren't exactly new, in fact they've been around for
            a while, but we can finally use them because they are supported everywhere.

        <h1>Array</h1>
        <pre>
var values = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

values.forEach((x)=>console.log(x));
var doubled = values.map((x) => x*2);

//find all values that match the filter
var evens = values.filter((x)=>x%2==0);

//true if at least one item matches
var any = values.some((x) => x > 10);

//find the first that matches
var six = values.find((x) =>  x >= 6);
//find the index of the first that match
var index = values.findIndex((x) =>  x >= 6);
//reduce the array to a single value
var sum = values.reduce((a,b) => a+b, 0);
        </pre>


        <aside>Array has a bunch of awesome utility methods which work great with arrow functions. You'll never need to write a traditional loop again.

    console.log("value = ", obj[key]);
});
        </pre>
        <aside>For working with hashmaps and other objects, the Object API has some useful functions too. Object.keys will give
            you a list of every property name on an object, in a predictable order. I use this all the time.

        <h1>Things to definitely avoid for now</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Destructuring</li>
            <li>Modules</li>
            <li>Default Parameters</li>
            <li>Spread Operator</li>
        </ul>
        <aside>
        <p>Destructuring. This lets you pull values out of an object by name.
        it can be useful in a few situation, but the best use i've found is
        extracting functions from modules. Unfortunately modules are still a
        mess and don't work the same everywhere, so avoid for now. </p>
            <p>Now, when I wrote original this presentation modules were still problematic without
            using a transpiler to work in systems that don't support
            modules yet, and Node didn't support the new modules syntax. However,
            as of a few weeks ago Node and the browser have moved forward, so
            it's worth looking into modules now. The next time
            I give this presentation I think it'll be time to add modules.</p>
        <p>Along with destructuring you can ignore tricks like default
            parameters, and the spread operator. I find these to only
        be useful when you are doing heavy functional programming.</p>

            There's a bunch of other things coming in ES6 that are genuinely

            hold off for a while. These include symbols, generators, iterators,

    }
    doStuff() {
    }
    doMoreStuff() {
    }
}</pre>
    <aside>
    <p>There is also a new class syntax. It still uses JavaScript's prototypical
    inheritance. We aren't writing Java or C++ here. But the new syntax does make
        it cleaner to define a class.
    However, it's not as valuable without the
    new module support but it's pretty solid so you are safe using it today
        if you want.</p>
        <p>If you are doing React then you will definitely want to use the new
        class syntax.</p>

  return "done"
}
makeRequest()

        </pre>
        <aside>
            <p>There is also a new async syntax which builds on top of
            Promises to make writing asynchronous code
                even cleaner.  This is going to be a big
                part of the future but until you are comfortable with Promises
                I don't suggest going to async await. Also support
                has only just been added to Node and some browsers, so I'd
                wait until it's a little more mature and there's better
                documentation.

        Most desktop and mobile browsers support everything I've shown you.
        However, depending on your audience you may have older
        browsers / older mobile OSes that don’t.  Whenever you want to know
        if something is ready, go to caniuse.com. It will tell you
        what versions of each browser support what.

    <h1>Code for the future</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Transpilers</li>
        <li>Babel</li>
        <li>Webpack</li>
        <li>React JSX</li>
    </ul>

    <aside>
        <p>However, even if your audience uses older browsers you don't have to wait.</p>
        <p>In the past we would say: wait until x% of the user audience can support this. Today, we say: code for the future and let a compiler worry about the past. simplest way to use babel or web pack.    </p>
        <p>A transpiler is a compiler that converts Javascript to a different
        form of Javascript.</p>
        <p>
            If you are using
            a react setup then you are already using a transpiler.
            If you aren't using react then just google for babel or webpack starter
            kit.</p>

        <p>using these in your code will make your code better and prepare for the future. as tools and browsers mature you won’t need to change your code. just one day you’ll be able to drop the transpiler step.
        </p>

        <p>Also, if you are shipping a JS app then you'll want to have a compile
            step anyway because you can add in code linters, minimizers, and compressors
            that check for errors and optmize your code before it's downloaded
            by your users.</p>
